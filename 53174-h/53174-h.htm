  <h2 class='c005'>PUBLISHER'S NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'><em>The reception accorded to the pocket edition of Dean
Plumptre's “Dante” has encouraged the publishers to
issue in the same</em> format <em>the Dean's masterly translation
of the Tragedies of Æschylos.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>In preparing the present issue they have followed the
carefully revised text of the second edition, and have
included the scholarly and suggestive annotations with
which the Dean invariably delighted to enrich his work
as a translator.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>The seven Plays, which are all that remain of the
seventy or eighty with which Æschylos is credited, are
presented in their chronological order. Passages in which
the reading or the rendering is more or less conjectural,
and in which, accordingly, the aid of the commentator is
advisable, are marked by an asterisk<a id='asterisk'></a>; and passages
which are regarded as spurious by editors of authority
have been placed in brackets.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>In translating the Choral Odes the Dean used such
unrhymed metres—observing the strophic and antistrophic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>arrangement—as seemed to him most analogous in their
general rhythmical effect to those of the original. He
added in an appendix, however, for the sake of those who
preferred the rhymed form with which they were familiar,
a rhymed version of the chief Odes of the Oresteian
trilogy. Those in the other dramas did not appear to him
to be of equal interest, or to lend themselves with equal
facility to a like attempt. The Greek text on which the
translation is based is, for the most part, that of Mr.
Paley's edition of 1861.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>A translation was also given of the Fragments which
have survived the wreck of the lost plays, so that the
work contains all that has been left to us associated
with the name of Æschylos.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>In the present edition a chronological outline has been
substituted for the biographical sketch of the poet, who
from his daring enlargement of the scope of the drama,
the magnificence of his spectacular effects and the
splendour of his genius, was rightly honoured as “the
Father of Tragedy.”</em></p>

<p class='c006'><em>ARGUMENT.—When Xerxes came to the throne of
Persia, remembering how his father Dareios had sought
to subdue the land of the Hellenes, and seeking to avenge
the defeat of Datis and Artaphernes on the field of
Marathon, he gathered together a mighty host of all
nations under his dominion, and led them against Hellas.
And at first he prospered and prevailed, crossed the
Hellespont, and defeated the Spartans at Thermopylæ,
and took the city of Athens, from which the greater part
of its citizens had fled. But at last he and his armament
met with utter overthrow at Salamis. Meanwhile Atossa,
the mother of Xerxes, with her handmaids and the elders
of the Persians, waited anxiously at Susa, where was the
palace of the great king, for tidings of her son.</em></p>
<hr class='c012' />

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><em>Note.</em>—Within two years after the battle of Salamis, the
feeling of natural exultation was met by Phrynichos in a
tragedy bearing the title of <cite>The Phœnikians</cite>, and having for its
subject the defeat of Xerxes. As he had come under the displeasure
of the Athenian <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">demos</span></i> for having brought on the stage
the sufferings of their Ionian kinsmen in his <cite>Capture of Miletos</cite>,
he was apparently anxious to regain his popularity by a
“sensation” drama of another kind; and his success seems to
have prompted Æschylos to a like attempt five years later, B.C.
473. The Tetralogy to which the play belonged, and which
gained the first prize on its representation, included the two
tragedies (unconnected in subject) of <cite>Phineus</cite> and <cite>Glaucos</cite>, and
the satyric drama of <cite>Prometheus the Fire-stealer</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The play has, therefore, the interest of being strictly a contemporary
narrative of the battle of Salamis and its immediate
consequences, by one who may himself have been present at it,
and whose brother Ameinias (Herod, viii. 93) distinguished himself
in it by a special act of heroism. As such, making all
allowance for the influence of dramatic exigencies, and the
tendency to colour history so as to meet the tastes of patriotic
Athenians, it may claim, where it differs from the story told by
Herodotos, to be a more trustworthy record. And it has, we
must remember, the interest of being the only extant drama of
its class, the only tragedy the subject of which is not taken from
the cycle of heroic myths, but from the national history of the
time. Far below the Oresteian Trilogy as it may seem to us as
a work of art, having more the character of a spectacle than a
poem, it was, we may well believe, unusually successful at the
time, and it is said to have been chosen by Hiero for reproduction
in Syracuse after Æschylos had settled there under his patronage.</p>

title of honour given to the veteran councillors of the king
(Xenoph. <cite>Anab.</cite> i. 15), just as that of the “Immortals” was
chosen for his body-guard (Herod, vii. 83).</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Susa was pre-eminently the treasury of the Persian kings
(Herod, v. 49; Strabo, xv. p. 731), their favourite residence in
spring, as Ecbatana in Media was in summer and Babylon in
winter.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Kissia was properly the name of the district in which Susa
stood; but here, and in v. 123, it is treated as if it belonged to
a separate city. Throughout the play there is, indeed, a lavish
use of Persian barbaric names of persons and places, without a
very minute regard to historical accuracy.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here, as in Herodotos and Greek writers generally, the
title, “the King,” or “the great King,” was enough. It could
be understood only of the Persian. The latter name had been
borne by the kings of Assyria (2 Kings xviii. 28). A little later
it passed into the fuller, more boastful form of “The King of
kings.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The inhabitants of the Delta of the Nile, especially those of

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The epithet was applied probably by Æschylos to the
Lydians properly so called, the barbaric race with whom the
Hellenes had little or nothing in common. They, in dress, diet,
mode of life, their distaste for the contests of the arena, seemed
to the Greeks the very type of effeminacy. The Ionian Greeks,
however, were brought under the same influence, and gradually
acquired the same character. The suppression of the name of
the Ionians in the list of the Persian forces may be noticed as
characteristic. The Athenian poet would not bring before an
Athenian audience the shame of their Asiatic kinsmen.</p>

period as early as the time of the Hebrew Judges (Judg. v. 3).
Herodotos (vii. 140) gives an Oracle of Delphi in which the same

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r15'>15</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The description, though put into the mouth of Persians, is
meant to flatter Hellenic pride. The Persians and their army
were for the most part light-armed troops only, barbarians
equipped with javelins or bows. In the sculptures of Persepolis,
as in those of Nineveh and Khorsabad, this mode of warfare is
throughout the most conspicuous. They, the Hellenes, were
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hoplites</span></i>, warriors of the spear and the shield, the cuirass and
the greaves.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A touch of Athenian exultation in their life as seamen. To
them the sea was almost a home. They were familiar with it
from childhood. To the Persians it was new and untried. They
had a new lesson to learn, late in the history of the nation, late
in the lives of individual soldiers.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stress is laid by the Hellenic poet, as in the <cite>Agamemnon</cite>
(v. 895), and in v. 707 of this play, on the tendency of the East
to give to its kings the names and the signs of homage which
were due only to the Gods. The Hellenes might deify a dead
hero, but not a living sovereign. On different grounds the
Jews shrank, as in the stories of Nebuchadnezzar and Dareios
(Dan. iii. 6), from all such acts.</p>

Possibly, however, the Median may be Kyaxares I., the father
of Astyages, and so the succession here would harmonise with
that of Herodotos. The whole succession must be looked on as

whose own temples had been outraged. But other sanctuaries
also, the temples at Delphi and Abæ, had shared the same fate,
and these sins against the Gods of Hellas were naturally connected
in the thoughts of the Greeks with the subsequent
disasters of the Persians. In Egypt these outrages had an
iconoclastic character. In Athens they were a retaliation for
the destruction of the temple at Sardis (Herod. v. 102).</p>

<p class='c006'>ARGUMENT.—<em>When Œdipus king of Thebes discovered
that he had unknowingly been the murderer of
his father, and had lived in incest with his mother, he
blinded himself. And his two sons, Eteocles and
Polyneikes, wishing to banish the remembrance of these
horrors from the eyes of men, at first kept him in confinement.
And he, being wroth with them, prayed that they
might divide their inheritance with the sword. And they,
in fear lest the prayer should be accomplished, agreed to
reign in turn, each for a year, and Eteocles, as the elder
of the two, took the first turn. But when at the end of
the year Polyneikes came to ask for the kingdom, Eteocles
refused to give way, and sent him away empty. So
Polyneikes went to Argos and married the daughter of
Adrastos the king of that country, and gathered together
a great army under six great captains, himself going as
the seventh, and led it against Thebes. And so they
compassed it about, and at each of the seven gates of the
city was stationed one of the divisions of the army.</em></p>

the Peloponnesian war (Thuc. iii. 58, 59), that it was noble and
right for Hellenes to destroy a city of the barbarians, but that
they should spare one belonging to a people of their own stock.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f78'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r78'>78</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The characteristic feature of the Argive soldiers was, that
they bore a shield painted white (comp. Sophocles, <cite>Antig.</cite> v.

devices and mottoes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r79'>79</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In solemn supplications, the litanies of the ancient world,
especially in those to Pallas, the suppliants carried with them in
procession the shawl or <i>peplos</i> of the Goddess, and with it
enwrapt her statue. To carry boughs of trees in the hands was
one of the uniform, probably indispensable, accompaniments of
such processions.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f80'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r80'>80</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words recall our thoughts to the original use of the trident,
which became afterwards a symbol of Poseidon, as

larger fish of the Archipelago. Comp. <cite>Pers.</cite> v. 426, where the

<div class='footnote' id='f84'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r84'>84</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The name of Onca belonged especially to the Theban worship
of Pallas, and was said to have been of Phœnikian origin,
introduced by Cadmos. There seems, however, to have been a
town Onkæ in Bœotia, with which the name was doubtless
connected.</p>

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f86'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r86'>86</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The vehemence with which Eteocles reproves the wild
frenzied wailing of the Chorus may be taken as an element of
the higher culture showing itself in Athenian life, which led
Solon to restrain such lamentations by special laws (Plutarch,
<cite>Solon</cite>, c. 20). Here, too, we note in Æschylos an echo of the
teaching of Epimenides.</p>

of his God upon the prow of his ship (often, as in Acts xxviii.
II, that of the <em>Dioscuri</em>), and called to it for deliverance (comp.
Jonah i. 8).</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f88'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r88'>88</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Eteocles seems to wish for a short, plain prayer for deliverance,
instead of the cries and supplications and vain repetitions
of the Chorus.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f89'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r89'>89</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The thought thus expressed was, that the Gods, yielding to
the mightier law of destiny, or in their wrath at the guilt of men,
left the city before its capture. The feeling was all but universal.
Its two representative instances are found in Virgil, <cite>Æn.</cite> 351—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r94'>94</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here, as in v. 571, Tydeus appears as the real leader of the
expedition, who had persuaded Adrastos and the other chiefs to
join in it, and Amphiaraos, the prophet, the son of Œcleus, as
having all along foreseen its disastrous issue. The account of the
expedition in the <cite>Œdipus at Colonos</cite> (1300-1330) may be compared
with this.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f95'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r95'>95</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The legend of the Medusa's head on the shield of Athena
shows the practice of thus decorating shields to have been of remote
date. In Homer it does not appear as common, and the account
given of the shield of Achilles lays stress upon the work of the
artist (Hephæstos) who wrought the shield in relief, not, as here,
upon painted insignia. They were obviously common in the
time of Æschylos.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f96'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r96'>96</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The older families of Thebes boasted that they sprang from
the survivors of the Sparti, who, sprung from the Dragon's teeth,
waged deadly war against each other, till all but five were slain.
The later settlers, who were said to have come with Cadmos,
stood to these as the “greater” to the “lesser <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gentes</span></i>” at Rome.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r100'>100</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The phrase and thought were almost proverbial in Athens.
Men, as citizens, were thought of as fed at a common table,
bound to contribute their gifts to the common stock. When
they offered up their lives in battle, they were giving, as Pericles
says (Thucyd. ii. 43), their noblest “contribution,” paying in
full their subscription to the society of which they were members.</p>

it was a man of much contention.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f109'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r109'>109</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words are obscure, but seem to refer to the badge of

which went with snow-white sails, and accompanied by joyful
pæans, on a solemn mission from Athens to Delos. In contrast
with this type of joy, Æschylos draws the picture of the boat of
Charon, which passes over the gloomy pool accompanied by the
sighs and gestures of bitter lamentation. So, in the old Attic
legend, the ship that annually carried seven youths and maidens
to the Minotaur of Crete was conspicuous for its black sails.</p>

borne in mind as we read passages like that which follows. They
were not meant to be <em>read</em>. Uttered in a passionate recitative,
accompanied by expressive action, they probably formed a very
effective element in the actual representation of the tragedy. We
may look on it as the only extant specimen of the kind of wailing
which was characteristic of Eastern burials, and which was
slowly passing away in Greece under the influence of a higher
culture. The early fondness of Æschylos for a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">finale</span></i> of this
nature is seen also in <cite>The Persians</cite>, and in a more solemn and
subdued form, in the <cite>Eumenides</cite>. The feeling that there was

itself alike in the legislation of Solon, and the eloquence of

denial of burial, it will be remembered, was looked on as not

peace. As such it was the punishment of parricides and traitors.</p>

<p class='c006'><em>ARGUMENT.—In the old time, when Cronos was
sovereign of the Gods, Zeus, whom he had begotten, rose
up against him, and the Gods were divided in their counsels,
some, the Titans chiefly, siding with the father, and
some with the son. And Prometheus, the son of Earth or
Themis, though one of the Titans, supported Zeus, as did
also Okeanos, and by his counsels Zeus obtained the
victory, and Cronos was chained in Tartaros, and the
Titans buried under mountains, or kept in bonds in
Hades. And then Prometheus, seeing the miseries of the
race of men, of whom Zeus took little heed, stole the fire
which till then had belonged to none but Hephæstos and
was used only for the Gods, and gave it to mankind, and
taught them many arts whereby their wretchedness was
lessened. But Zeus being wroth with Prometheus for
this deed, sent Hephæstos, with his two helpers, Strength
and Force, to fetter him to a rock on Caucasos.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>And in yet another story was the cruelty of the Gods
made known. For Zeus loved Io, the daughter of Inachos,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>king of Argos, and she was haunted by visions of the
night, telling her of his passion, and she told her father
thereof. And Inachos, sending to the God at Delphi,
was told to drive Io forth from her home. And Zeus
gave her the horns of a cow, and Hera, who hated her
because she was dear to Zeus, sent with her a gadfly that
stung her, and gave her no rest, and drove her over many
lands.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>Note.</em>—The play is believed to have been the second of a
Trilogy, of which the first was <em>Prometheus the Fire-giver</em>, and
the third <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f136'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r136'>136</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The scene seems at first an exception to the early conventional
rule, which forbade the introduction of a third actor on the
Greek stage. But it has been noticed that (1) Force does not
speak, and (2) Prometheus does not speak till Strength and
Force have retired, and that it is therefore probable that the
whole work of nailing is done on a lay figure or effigy of some
kind, and that one of the two who had before taken part in the
dialogue then speaks behind it in the character of Prometheus.
So the same actor must have appeared in succession as Okeanos,
Io, and Hermes.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f137'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r137'>137</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Prometheus (<em>Forethought</em>) is the son of Themis (<em>Right</em>) the
second occupant of the Pythian Oracle (<cite>Eumen</cite>. v. 2). His
sympathy with man leads him to impart the gift which raised
them out of savage animal life, and for this Zeus, who
appears throughout the play as a hard taskmaster, sentences
him to fetters. Hephæstos, from whom this fire had been stolen,
has a touch of pity for him. Strength, who comes as the servant,
not of Hephæstos, but of Zeus himself, acts, as such, with
merciless cruelty.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f138'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r138'>138</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The generalised statement refers to Zeus, as having but
recently expelled Cronos from his throne in Heaven.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f139'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r139'>139</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hephæstos, as the great fire-worker, had taught Prometheus
to use the fire which he afterwards bestowed on men.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f140'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r140'>140</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Perhaps, “All might is ours except o'er Gods to rule.”</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f141'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r141'>141</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words indicate that the effigy of Prometheus, now
nailed to the rock, was, as being that of a Titan, of colossal size.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f142'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r142'>142</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The touch is characteristic as showing that here, as in the
<cite>Eumenides</cite>, Æschylos relied on the horribleness of the masks,
as part of the machinery of his plays.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f143'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r143'>143</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The silence of Prometheus up to this point was partly, as
has been said, consequent on the conventional laws of the Greek
drama, but it is also a touch of supreme insight into the heroic
temper. In the presence of his torturers, the Titan will not
utter even a groan. When they are gone, he appeals to the
sympathy of Nature.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f144'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r144'>144</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The legend is from Hesiod (<cite>Theogon.</cite>, v. 567). The fennel,
or <em>narthex</em>, seems to have been a large umbelliferous plant,
with a large stem filled with a sort of pith, which was used
when dry as tinder. Stalks were carried as wands (the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">thyrsi</span></i>)
by the men and women who joined in Bacchanalian processions.
In modern botany, the name is given to the plant which produces
Asafœtida, and the stem of which, from its resinous
character, would burn freely, and so connect itself with the
Promethean myth. On the other hand, the Narthex Asafœtida
is found at present only in Persia, Afghanistan, and the
Punjaub.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f145'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r145'>145</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The ocean nymphs, like other divine ones, would be
anointed with ambrosial unguents, and the odour would be
wafted before them by the rustling of their wings. This too we
may think of as part of the “stage effects” of the play.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f146'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r146'>146</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words are not those of a vague terror only. The
sufferer knows that his tormentor is to come to him before long
on wings, and therefore the sound as of the flight of birds is full

appear as the sons of two sisters. As other Titans were thought
of as buried under volcanoes, so this one was identified with the
mountain which had been seen by travellers to Western Africa,
or in the seas beyond it, rising like a column to support the
vault of heaven. In Herodotos (iv. 174) and all later writers,
the name is given to the chain of mountains in Lybia, as being
the “pillar of the firmament;” but Humboldt and others identify
it with the lonely peak of Teneriffe, as seen by Phœnikian or
Hellenic voyagers. Teneriffe, too, like most of the other Titan
mountains, was at one time volcanic. Homer (<cite>Odyss.</cite> i. 53)
represents him as holding the pillars which separate heaven
from earth; Hesiod (<cite>Theogon.</cite> v. 517) as himself standing near
the Hesperides (this too points to Teneriffe), sustaining the

liability to earthquakes which has marked nearly every period of
its history, led men to connect it also with the traditions of the
Titans, some accordingly placing the home of Typhon in
Phrygia, some near Sardis, some, as here, in Kilikia. Hesiod
(<cite>Theogon.</cite> v. 820) describes Typhon (or Typhoeus) as a serpent-monster
hissing out fire; Pindar (<cite>Pyth.</cite> i. 30, viii. 21) as lying

(Herod. ii. 41), as Isis was by those of Egypt. The points of
contact between the myth of Io and that of Prometheus, as
adopted, or perhaps developed, by Æschylos are—(1) that from
her the destined deliverer of the chained Titan is to come; (2)
that both were suffering from the cruelty of Zeus; (3) that the
wanderings of Io gave scope for the wild tales of far countries
on which the imagination of the Athenians fed greedily. But,
as the <cite>Suppliants</cite> may serve to show, the story itself had a strange
fascination for him. In the birth of Epaphos, and Io's release
from her frenzy, he saw, it may be, a reconciliation of what had
seemed hard to reconcile, a solution of the problems of the
world, like in kind to that which was shadowed forth in the lost

found refuge in Egypt, and having been touched by Zeus,
had given birth to Epaphos, it came to pass that he and
his descendants ruled over the region of Canôpos, near one
of the seven mouths of Neilos. And in the fifth generation
there were two brothers, Danaos and Ægyptos, the
sons of Belos, and the former had fifty daughters and the
latter fifty sons, and Ægyptos sought the daughters of
Danaos in marriage for his sons. And they, looking on
the marriage as unholy, and hating those who wooed

<p class='c006'><em>ARGUMENT.—Ten years had passed since Agamemnon,
son of Atreus, king of Mykenæ, had led the
Hellenes to Troïa to take vengeance on Alexandros (also
known as Paris), son of Priam. For Paris had basely
wronged Menelaos, king of Sparta, Agamemnon's brother,
in that, being received by him as a guest, he enticed his
wife Helena to leave her lord and go with him to Troïa.
And now the tenth year had come, and Paris was slain,
and the city of the Troïans was taken and destroyed, and
Agamemnon and the Hellenes were on their way homeward
with the spoil and prisoners they had taken. But
meanwhile Clytæmnestra too, Agamemnon's queen, had
been unfaithful, and had taken as her paramour Ægisthos,
son of that Thyestes whom Atreus, his brother, had
made to eat, unknowing, of the flesh of his own children.
And now, partly led by her adulterer, and partly seeking
to avenge the death of her daughter Iphigeneia, whom
Agamemnon had sacrificed to appease the wrath of
Artemis, and partly also jealous because he was bringing
back Cassandra, the daughter of Priam, as his concubine,
she plotted with Ægisthos against her husband's life.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_1010'>1010</span>But this was done secretly, and she stationed a guard on
the roof of the royal palace to give notice when he saw
the beacon-fires, by which Agamemnon had promised that
he would send tidings that Troïa was taken.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><em>Note.</em>—The unfaithfulness of Clytæmnestra and the murder of
Agamemnon had entered into the Homeric cycle of the legends
of the house of Atreus. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, however, Ægisthos is
the chief agent in this crime (<em>Odyss.</em> iii. 264, iv. 91, 532, xi. 409);
and the manner of it differs from that which Æschylos has
adopted. Clytæmnestra first appears as slaying both her
husband and Cassandra in Pindar (<em>Pyth.</em> xi. 26).</p>

clearly become common in Attica among the class to which the
watchman was supposed to belong, and had given rise to proverbial
phrases like that in the text. The Greeks themselves
supposed it to have been invented by the Lydians (Herod. i. 94),
or Palamedes, one of the heroes of the tale of Troïa, but it
enters also into Egyptian legends (Herod. ii. 122), and its prevalence
from remote antiquity in the farther East, as in the Indian
story of Nala and Damayanti, makes it probable that it originated
there. The game was commonly played, as the phrase
shows, with three dice, the highest throw being that which gave
three sixes. Æschylos, it may be noted, appears in a lost drama,
which bore the title of <em>Palamedes</em>, to have brought the game
itself into his plot. It is referred to, as invented by that hero,
in a fragment of Sophocles (<cite>Fr.</cite> 380), and again in the
proverb,—</p>

him to neglect the wonted sacrifices to Zeus, but it seems
better to see in them a reference to the sin of Paris. He, at
least, who had carried off his host's wife, had not offered acceptable
sacrifices, had neglected all sacrifices to Zeus Xenios, the
God of host and guest. The allusion to the sacrifice of Iphigeneia,
which some (Donaldson and Paley) have found here,
and the wrath of Clytæmnestra, which Agamemnon will fail to
soothe, seems more far-fetched.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r277'>277</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Chorus, though too old to take part in the expedition,
are yet able to tell both of what passed as the expedition started,
and of the terrible fulfilment of the omens which they had seen.
The two eagles are, of course, in the symbolism of prophecy, the
two chieftains, Menelaos and Agamemnon. The “white
feathers” of the one may point to the less heroic character of
Menelaos: so in v. 123, they are of “diverse mood.” The hare
whom they devour is, in the first instance, Troïa, and so far the
omen is good, portending the success of the expedition; but, as
Artemis hates the fierceness of the eagles, so there is, in the eyes
of the seer, a dark token of danger from her wrath against the
Atreidæ. Either their victory will be sullied by cruelty which
will bring down vengeance, or else there is some secret sin in the
past which must be atoned for by a terrible sacrifice. In the
legend followed by Sophocles (<cite>Electr.</cite> 566), Agamemnon had
offended Artemis by slaying a doe sacred to her, as he was
hunting. In the manifold meanings of such omens there is,
probably, a latent suggestion of the sacrifice of Iphigeneia by
the two chieftains, though this was at the time hidden from the
seer. The fact that they are seen on the right, not on the left
hand, was itself ominous of good.</p>

mourned for the death of Linos, the minstrel-son of Apollo and
Urania, brother of Orpheus, who was slain by Heracles—a type,
like Thammuz and Adonis, of life prematurely closed and bright
hopes never to be fulfilled,—had come to be the representative of
all songs of mourning. So Hesiod (in Eustath. on Hom. <cite>Il.</cite>,
vii. 569) speaks of the name, as applied to all funeral dirges over
poets and minstrels. So Herodotos (ii. 79) compares it, as the
type of this kind of music among the Greeks, with what he
found in Egypt connected with the name of Maneros, the only
son of the first king of Egypt, who died in the bloom of youth.
The name had, therefore, as definite a connotation for a Greek
audience as the words <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere</span></i> or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jubilate</span></i> would have for us,
and ought not, I believe, to disappear from the translation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r282'>282</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As a part of the drama the whole passage that follows is an
assertion by the Chorus that in this their trouble they will turn
to no other God, invoke no other name, but that of the Supreme
Zeus. But it can hardly be doubted that they have a meaning
beyond this, and are the utterance by the poet of his own
theology. In the second part of the Promethean trilogy (all
that we now know of it) he had represented Zeus as ruling in
the might of despotic sovereignty, the representative of a Power
which men could not resist, but also could not love, inflicting
needless sufferings on the sons of men. Now he has grown
wiser. The sovereignty of Zeus is accepted as part of the present
order of the world; trust in Him brings peace; the pain which
He permits is the one only way to wisdom. The stress laid upon
the name of Zeus implies a wish to cleave to the religion inherited
from the older Hellenes, as contrasted with those with which
their intercourse with the East had made the Athenians familiar.
Like the voice which came to Epimenides, as he was building a
sanctuary to the Muses, bidding him dedicate it not to them but
to Zeus (Diog. Laert. i. 10), it represents a faint approximation
to a truer, more monotheistic creed than that of the popular
mythology.</p>

reckoned by nights rather than by days, and spoke of “the

with such reverence. The dramatist puts into her mouth the

falleth upon men.” So Sophocles puts like thoughts into the

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r295'>295</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The description that follows, over and above its general
interest, had, probably, for an Athenian audience, that of representing
the actual succession of beacon-stations, by which they,
in the course of the wars, under Pericles, had actually received
intelligence from the coasts of Asia. A glance at the map will
show the fitness of the places named—Ida, Lemnos, Athos,
Makistos (a mountain in Eubœa), Messapion (on the coast of
Bœotia), over the plains of the Asôpos to Kithæron, in the south of
the same province, then over Gorgopis, a bay of the Corinthian
Gulf, to Ægiplanctos in Megaris, then across to a headland
overlooking the Saronic Gulf, to the Arachnæan hill in Argolis.
The word “<em>courier</em>-fire” connects itself also with the system of
posts or messengers, which the Persian kings seem to have been
the first to organise, and which impressed the minds both of
Hebrews (Esth. viii. 14) and Greeks (Herod. viii. 98) by their
regular transmission of the king's edicts, or of special news.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f296'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r296'>296</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our ignorance of the details of the <em>Lampadephoria</em>, or
“torch-race games,” in honour of the fire-God, Prometheus,
makes the allusion to them somewhat obscure. As described
by Pausanias (I. xxx. 2), the runners started with lighted torches
from the altar of Prometheus in the Academeia and ran towards
the city. The first who reached the goal with his torch still
burning became the winner. If all the torches were extinguished,
then all were losers. As so described, however, there is no succession,
no taking the torch from one and passing it on to
another, like that described here and in the well-known line of
Lucretius (ii. 78),</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et quasi cursores vitaï lampada tradunt.</span>”</div>
      <div class='line'>(And they, as runners, pass the torch of life.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, there are descriptions which show that such
a transfer was the chief element of the game. This is, indeed,
implied both in this passage and in the comparison between the
game and the Persian courier-system in Herod. viii. 98. The
two views may be reconciled by supposing (1) that there were
sets of runners, vying with each other as such, rather than individually,
or (2) that a runner whose speed failed him though
his torch kept burning, was allowed to hand it on to another who
was more likely to win the race, but whose torch was out. The
next line seems meant to indicate where the comparison failed. In
the torch-race which Clytæmnestra describes there had been no
contest. One and the self-same fire (the idea of succession passing
into that of continuity) had started and had reached the goal, and
so had won the prize. An alternative rendering would be,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He wins who is first in, though starting last.”</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f297'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r297'>297</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The complete foot-race was always to the column which
marked the end of the course, round it, and back again. In
getting to Troïa, therefore, but half the race was done.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f298'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r298'>298</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dramatically the words refer to the practical impiety of
evildoers like Paris, with, perhaps, a half-latent allusion to that of
Clytæmnestra. But it can hardly be doubted that for the Athenian
audience it would have a more special significance, as a protest
against the growing scepticism, what in a later age would have
been called the Epicureanism, of the age of Pericles. It is the
assertion of the belief of Æschylos in the moral government of
the world. The very vagueness of the singular, “One there
was,” would lead the hearers to think of some teacher like
Anaxagoras, whom they suspected of Atheism.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f299'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r299'>299</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Chorus sees in the overthrow of Troïa, an instance of
this righteous retribution. The audience were, perhaps, intended
to think also of the punishment which had fallen on the
Persians for the sacrilegious acts of their fathers. The “things
inviolable” are the sanctities of the ties of marriage and hospitality,
both of which Paris had set at nought.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r300'>300</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here, and again in v. 612, we have a similitude drawn from
the metallurgy of Greek artists. Good bronze, made of copper
and tin, takes the green rust which collectors prize, but when
rubbed, the brightness reappears. If zinc be substituted for tin,
as in our brass, or mixed largely with it, the surface loses its
polish, oxidizes and becomes black. It is, however, doubtful
whether this combination of metals was at the time in use, and
the words may simply refer to different degrees of excellence in
bronze properly so called.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r319'>319</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is an ambiguity, possibly an intentional one, in the
comparison which Clytæmnestra uses. If there was no such art
as that of “staining bronze” (or copper) known at the time, the
words would be a natural phrase enough to describe what was
represented as an impossibility. Later on in the history of art,
however, as in the time of Plutarch, a process so described
(perhaps analogous to enamelling) is mentioned (<cite>De Pyth.
Orac</cite>. § 2) as common. If we suppose the art to have been a
mystery known to the few, but not to the many, in the time of
Æschylos, then the words would have for the hearers the point
of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entendre</span></i>. She seems to the mass to disclaim what
yet, to those in the secret she acknowledges.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another rendering refers “bronze” to the “sword,” and
makes the stains those of blood; as though she said, “I am as
guiltless of adultery as of murder,” while yet she knew that she
had committed the one, and meant to commit the other. The
possibility of such a meaning is certainly in the words, and with
a sharp-witted audience catching at ænigmas and dark sayings
may have added to their suggestiveness. The ambiguous comment
of the Chorus shows that they read, as between the lines,
the shameful secret which they knew, but of which the Herald
was ignorant.</p>

something which approaches, however imperfectly, to an

by abandoning the attempt to translate it. “Hell of men, and

given him to know of the righteous government of God. The
dominant creed of Greece at the time was, that the Gods were
envious of man's prosperity, that this alone, apart from moral
evil, was enough to draw down their wrath, and bring a curse
upon the prosperous house. So, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, Amasis tells Polycrates
(Herod. iii. 40) that the unseen Divinity that rules the world is
envious, that power and glory are inevitably the precursors of
destruction. Comp. also the speech of Artabanos (Herod. vii.

Persian kings required of their subjects, the prostration at their
feet, the earth spread over with costly robes. Of the latter
custom we have examples in the history of Jehu (2 Kings ix. 13),
in our Lord's entry into Jerusalem (Mark xi. 8), in the usages
of modern Persian kings (Malcolm's <cite>Persia</cite>, i. 580); perhaps
also in the true rendering of Ps. xlv. 14. “She shall be brought
unto the king <em>on</em> raiment of needle-work.” In the march of
Xerxes across the Hellespont myrtle-boughs strown on the
bridge of boats took the place of robes (Herod. vii. 54). To
the Greek character, with its strong love of independence, such
customs were hateful. The case of Pausanias, who offended
the national feeling by assuming the outward state of the
Persian kings, must have been recalled to the minds of the
Athenians, intentionally or otherwise, by such a passage as

Tabernacle and Temple, through all their history (Juven.,
<cite>Sat.</cite> vi. 159), in all mosques to the present day. Agamemnon,
yielding to the temptress, seeks to make a compromise with his
conscience. He will walk upon the tapestry, but will treat it as
if it, of right, belonged to the Gods, and were a consecrated
thing. It is probably in connection with this incident that

is represented as lacking the honour which comes from them

(<cite>Phys. Geog.</cite>, c. xxxiii. 3) describes their note as “like that of a
violin.” The same fact is reported of the swans of Iceland and
other regions of the far North. The strange, tender beauty of
the passage in the <cite>Phædo</cite> of Plato (p. 85, a), which speaks of
them as singing when at the point of death, has done more than
anything else to make the illustration one of the commonplaces

<p class='c006'><em>ARGUMENT.—It came to pass, after Agamemnon had
been slain, that Clytæmnestra and Ægisthos ruled in
Argos, and all things seemed to go well with them.
Orestes, who was heir to Agamemnon, they had sent
away to the care of Strophios of Phokis, and there he
abode. Electra, his sister, mourned in secret over her
father's death, and prayed for vengeance, but no avenger
came. And when Orestes grew up to man's estate, he
went to ask counsel of the God at Delphi, and the Gods
straitly charged him to take vengeance on his father's
murderers; and so he started on his journey with his
trusty friend Pylades, and arrived at Argos. And it
chanced that a little while before he came, the Gods sent
Clytæmnestra a fearful dream, that troubled her soul
greatly; and in her terror she bade Electra go with her
handmaids to pour libations on the tomb of Agamemnon,
that so she might appease his soul, and propitiate the
Powers that rule over the dark world of the dead.</em></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r401'>401</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hermes is invoked, (1) as the watcher over the souls of the
dead in Hades, and therefore the natural patron of the murdered
Agamemnon; (2) as exercising an authority delegated by Zeus,
and therefore capable of being, like Zeus himself, the deliverer
and helper of suppliants. So Electra, further on, invokes
Hermes in the same character. The line may, however, be
rendered,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Who stand'st as guardian of my father's house.”</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>The three opening lines are noticeable, as having been chosen
by Aristophanes as the special object for his satirical criticism
(<cite>Frogs</cite>, 1126-1176), abounding in a good score of ambiguities
and tautologies.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f402'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r402'>402</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words point to the two symbolic aspects of one and the
same practice. In both there are some points of analogy with
the earlier and later forms of the Nazarite vow among the Jews.
(1) As being part of the body, and yet separable from it without
mutilation, it became the representative of the whole man, and
as such was the sign of a votive dedication. As early as Homer,
it was the custom of youths to keep one long, flowing lock as
consecrated, and when they reached manhood, they cut it off,
and offered it to the river-god of their country, throwing it into
the stream, as that to which, directly and indirectly, they owed
their nurture. Here the offering is made to Inachos, as the
hero-founder of Argos, identified with the river that bore his
name. (2) They shaved their head, wholly or in part, as a token
as a token of grief, and then, because true grief for the dead was an
acceptable and propitiatory offering, this became the natural
offering for suppliants who offered their prayers at the tombs of
the departed. So in the <cite>Aias</cite> of Sophocles (v. 1174) Teucros
calls on Eurysakes to approach the corpse of his father, holding
in his hand locks of his own hair, his mother's, and that of
Teucros. In the offering which Achilles makes over the grave
of Patroclos of the hair which he had cherished for the river-god
of his fatherland, Spercheios, we have the union of the two
customs. Homer. <cite>Il.</cite> xxiii. 141-151.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f403'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r403'>403</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After the widespread fashion of the East, the handmaids of
Clytæmnestra (originally Troïan captives) had to rend their
clothes, beat their breasts, and lacerate their faces till the blood
came. The higher civilisation of Solon's laws had forbidden
these wild, barbarous forms of grief at Athens. Plutarch,
<cite>Solon</cite>, p. 164.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f404'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r404'>404</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Purposely, perhaps, obscure. They seem to say that the
old reverence for Agamemnon has passed away, and instead of
it there is only a slavish fear for Ægisthos. For the more acute,
however, they imply that those who have cause to fear are
Ægisthos and Clytæmnestra themselves.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f405'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r405'>405</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words, in their generalising sententiousness, refer
specially to the twofold crime of Ægisthos as an adulterer and
murderer. Then, in the Epode, the Chorus justify themselves
for their seeming inconsistency in thus abhorring the guilt, and
yet acting as instruments of the guilty in their attempts to escape
punishment.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f406'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r406'>406</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The mourners speak, of course, of Agamemnon and Orestes,
not of Ægisthos and Clytæmnestra.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f407'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r407'>407</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A mixture of meal, honey, and oil formed the half-liquid
substance commonly used for these funereal libations. The
“garlands” may be wreaths of flowers or fillets, or the word
may be used figuratively for the libation itself, as crowning the
mound in which Agamemnon lay.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f408'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r408'>408</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words point to a strange Athenian custom. When a
house was cleansed of that which defiled it, morally or physically,
the filth was carried in an earthen vessel to a place where three
ways met, and the worshipper flung the vessel behind him, and
walked away without turning to look at it. To Electra's mind,
the libation which her mother sends is equally unclean, and
should be treated in the same way. So in Hom. <cite>Il.</cite> i. 314, the
Argives purify themselves, and then cast the lustral water they
have used into the sea. Lev. vi. 11, gives us an analogous usage.
Comp. also Theocritos, <cite>Idyll</cite> xxiv., vv. 22-97.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f409'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r409'>409</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Partly it is the youth of Electra that seeks counsel from
those who had more experience; partly she shrinks from the
responsibility of being the first to utter the formula of execration.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f410'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r410'>410</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The word “escort” has a special reference to the function
of Hermes in the unseen world. As he was wont to act as guide
to the souls of the dead in their downward journey, so now
Electra prays that he may lead the blessings she asks for upward
from the dark depths of Earth.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f411'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r411'>411</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Skythian bow, long and elastic, bending either way,
like those of the Arabians (Herod. vii. 69). The connection of
Ares with the wild, fierce tribes of Thrakia and Skythia meets
us again and again in the literature of Greece. He was the
only God to whom they built temples (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</span></i> iv. 59). They
sacrificed human victims to an iron sword as his more appropriate
symbol (iv. 62). The use of iron for weapons of war
came to the Greeks from them (<cite>Seven ag. Th.</cite> 729; <cite>Prom.</cite> 714).</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f412'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r412'>412</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It may be worth while to compare the method adopted by
the three dramatists of Greece in bringing about the recognition
of the brother by the sister. (1) Here the lock of hair, in its peculiar
colour and texture resembling her own, followed by the likeness
of his footsteps to hers, prepares the way first for vague anticipations,
and then the robe she had made for him, leads to her
acceptance of Orestes on his own discovery of himself. To this it
has been objected, by Euripides in the first instance (<cite>Electra</cite>, vv.
462-500), that the evidence of the colour of the hair is weak,
that a young man's foot must have been larger than a maiden's,
and that he could not have worn as a man the garment she had
made for him as a child. It might be replied, perhaps, that
there are such things as hereditary resemblances extending to
the colour of the hair and the arch of the instep, and that the
robe may either have been shown instead of worn, or, being
worn, have been adapted for the larger growth. (2) In the
<cite>Electra</cite> of Sophocles the lock of hair alone convinces Chrysothemis
that her brother is near at hand (v. 900), while Electra
herself requires the further evidence of Agamemnon's seal
(v. 1223). In Euripides (v. 527), all proof fails till Orestes
shows a scar on his brow, which his sister remembers.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f413'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r413'>413</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The saying is probably one of the widespread proverbs
which imply parables. The idea is obviously that with which
we are familiar in the Gospel “grain of mustard seed.” Here,
as in the “kicking against the pricks” of Acts ix. 5, xxvi. 14,
and <cite>Agam.</cite> v. 1604, we are carried back to a period which lies
beyond the range of history as that in which men took note of
the analogies and embodied them in forms like this.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f414'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r414'>414</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So in the <cite>Odyssey</cite> (xix. 228), Odysseus appears as wearing
a woollen cloak, on which are embroidered the figures of a fawn
and a dog.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f415'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r415'>415</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An obvious reproduction of the words of Andromache
(<cite>Il.</cite> vi. 429).</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f416'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r416'>416</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words seem to imply that burning alive was known
among the Greeks as a punishment for the most atrocious
crimes. The “oozing pitch,” if we adopt that rendering,
apparently describes something like the “<i>tunica molesta</i>” of
Juvenal. (<cite>Sat.</cite> viii. 235.) Hesychios (s. v. <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Κωνῆσαι</span>) mentions
the practice as alluded to in a lost play of Æschylos.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f417'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r417'>417</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words are both doubtful and obscure. Taking the
reading which I have adopted, they seem to mean that while
men in general had means of propitiating the Erinnyes and
other Powers for the guilt of unavenged bloodshed, Orestes and
Electra had no such way of escape open to them. If they, the
next of kin, failed to do their work, they would be exposed to
the full storm of wrath. But a conjectural emendation of one
word gives us,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“For making known to men the earth-born ills</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f418'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r418'>418</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Either that old age would come prematurely, or that the
hair itself would share the leprous whiteness of the flesh.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f419'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r419'>419</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words, as taken in the text, refer to Orestes seeing
even in sleep the spectral forms of the Erinnyes. By some
editors the verse is placed after v. 276, and the lines then read
thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And that he calls fresh onsets of the Erinnyes</div>
      <div class='line'>As brought to issue from a father's blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seeing clearly, though he move his brow in darkness.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>So taken, the last line refers to Agamemnon, who, though in
the darkness of Hades, sees the penalties which will fail upon
his son should he neglect to take vengeance on his father's
murderers.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f420'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r420'>420</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stress is laid here, as in <cite>Agam.</cite> 1224, on the effeminacy of

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f421'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r421'>421</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The great law of retribution is repeated from <cite>Agam.</cite> 1564.
As one of the earliest utterances of man's moral sense, it was
referred popularly among the Greeks to Rhadamanthos, who
with Minos judged the souls of the dead in Hades. Comp.
Aristot. <cite>Ethic. Nicom.</cite>, v. 8.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f422'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r422'>422</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The funeral pyre, which consumes the body, leaves the life
and power of the man untouched. The spirit survives, and
calls on the Gods that dwell in darkness to avenge him. The
very cry of wailing tends, as a prayer to them, to the exposure
of the murderer.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f423'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r423'>423</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Lykians, of whom Glaucos and Sarpedon are the

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f424'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r424'>424</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words embody the widespread feeling that the absence
of funereal honours affected the spirit of the dead, and that the
souls with whom he dwelt held him in high or low esteem
according as they had been given or withheld.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f425'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r425'>425</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pindar (<cite>Pyth.</cite> x. 47), the contemporary of Æschylos, had
made the name of these Hyperborei well known to all Greeks.
The vague dreams of men, before the earth had been searched
out, pictured a happy land as lying beyond their reach. There
were Islands of the Blest in the far West; Æthiopians, peaceful
and long-lived, in the South; and far away, beyond the cold
North, a people exempt from the common evils of humanity.
The latter have been connected with the old Aryan belief in the
paradise of Mount Meru. Comp. also Herod. iv. 421; <cite>Prom.</cite>

<div class='footnote' id='f427'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r427'>427</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Perhaps, simply “the sharp and bitter cry.” But the
rendering in the text seems justified as repeating the wish already
expressed (v. 260), that the murderers may die by this form of
death.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f428'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r428'>428</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Chorus at this point renew their words and cries of
lamentation, smiting on their breasts. By some critics this
speech and Antistrophe VII. are assigned to Electra, Antistrophe
VIII. to the Chorus, with a corresponding change in the
pronouns “my” and “thy.” The Chorus, as consisting of
Troïan captives, is represented as adopting the more vehement
Asiatic forms of wailing. Among these the Arians, Kissians,
and Mariandynians (<cite>Pers.</cite> 920) seem to have been most conspicuous
for their skill in lamentation, and, as such, were in
request where hired mourners were wanted. Compare the
opening chorus, v. 22.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f429'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r429'>429</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The practice of mutilating the corpse of a murdered man by
cutting off his hands and feet and fastening them round his
waist, seems to have been looked on as rendering him powerless
to seek for vengeance. Comp. Soph. <cite>Elect.</cite> v. 437. This kind
of mutilation, and not mere wanton outrage, is what the Chorus
refer to.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r430'>430</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As in v. 351 the loss of honour among the dead was represented
as one consequence of the absence of funereal rites from
those who loved the dead, so here the restoration of the children
to their rights appears as the condition without which that dishonour
must continue. If they succeed, then, and then only,
can they offer funereal banquets, year by year, as was the
custom. There may be a special reference to an Argive custom
mentioned by Plutarch (<cite>Quæst. Græc.</cite>, c. 24) of sacrificing immediately
after the death of a relative to Apollo, and thirty days
later to Hermes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r433'>433</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The story of Althæa has perhaps been made most familiar
to English readers by Mr. Swinburne's <cite>Atalanta in Calydon</cite>.
More briefly told, the legend ran that she, being the wife of
Œneus, bare a son, who was believed to be the child of Ares—that
the Fates came to her when the boy, who was named
Meleagros, was seven days old, and told her that his life should
last until the firebrand then burning on the earth should be consumed.
She took the firebrand and quenched it, and laid it by
in a chest; but when Meleagros grew up, he joined in the chase
of the great boar of Calydon, and when he had slain it, gave the
skin as a trophy to Atalanta, and when his mother's brothers,
the sons of Thestios, claimed it as their right, he waxed wroth
with them and slew them. And then Althæa, in her grief, caring
more for her brothers than her son, took the brand from the
chest, and threw it into the fire, and so Meleagros died. Phrynichos
is said to have made the myth the subject of a drama. In
Homer (<cite>Il.</cite> x. 566), Althæa brings about her son's death by her
curses.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r434'>434</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Skylla (not to be confounded with the sea-monster of
Messina) was the daughter of Nisos, king of Megaris, who had
on his head a lock of purple hair, which was a charm that preserved
his life from all danger. And the Cretans under Minos
attacked Nisos, and besieged him in his city; and Minos won
the love of Skylla, and tempted her with gifts, and she cut off
her father's lock of hair, and so he perished. But Minos, scorning
her for her deed, bound her by the feet to the stern of his
ship and drowned her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r436'>436</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Chorus apparently is represented as on the point of
completing its catalogue of crimes committed by women with
the story of Clytæmnestra's guilt. Something leads them to
check themselves, and they are contented with a dark and vague
allusion.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f437'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r437'>437</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The story of the Lemnian women is told by Herodotos (vi.
138). They rose up against their husbands and put them all to
death; and the deed passed into a proverb, so that all great
crimes were spoken of as Lemnian. This guilt is that alluded
to in Strophe III.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f438'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r438'>438</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In every case of which the Chorus had spoken guilt had

Clytæmestra's words here also are full of significant ambiguity.
The “things that befit the house,” the proposed conference with
Ægisthos, her separation of Orestes from his companions, are
all indications of suspicion already half aroused. The last three
lines were probably spoken as an “aside.”</p>

to mean the cry of exultation which the Chorus will raise when
the deed of vengeance is accomplished; or, possibly (as Mr.

do the work of vengeance would also help to free him from
this wretchedness. But the Erinnyes followed him there
also, and took their places even within the holy shrine of
the Oracle, and while Orestes knelt on the central hearth

sent envoys to consult the oracle they were preceded by men

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r479'>479</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Æschylos apparently follows the <cite>Theogonia</cite> of Hesiod,
(l. 278), who describes the Gorgons as three in number,
daughters of Phorkys and Keto, and bearing the names of
Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa. The last enters into the Perseus
cycle of myths, as one of the monsters whom he conquered,
with a face once beautiful, but with her hair turned to serpents
by the wrath of Athena, and so dreadful to look upon that those
who gazed on her were turned to stone. When Perseus had
slain her, Athena placed her head in her ægis, and thus became
the terror of all who were foes to herself or her people. A wild
legendary account of them meets us in the <cite>Prom. Bound</cite>, v. 812.

had once received a guest under the shelter of his roof, not to
desert him, even though he might discover afterwards that he
had been guilty of great crimes, but to escort him safely to the
boundary of his territory. Thus Apollo, as the host with whom
Orestes had taken refuge, sends Hermes, the escort God, to
guide and defend him on his way to Athens.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r483'>483</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The thought that the highest wisdom came to men rather in
“visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,” than
through the waking senses, which we have already met with in

from the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cultus</span></i> of the Eumenides, and to them only as
daughters of Night were midnight sacrifices offered. We must
not lose sight of the thought thus implied, that Clytæmnestra
had herself lived, after her deed of guilt, in perpetual terror of
the Erinnyes, seeking to soothe them by her sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r485'>485</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The common rendering “in a dream” gives a sufficient
meaning, and is, of course, tenable enough. But there is a
force in the repetition of the same word, as in v. 116, which is
thus lost, and which I have endeavoured to preserve. The
Erinnyes, thus impotent in their rage, are as much mere dreamlike
spectres as is the ghost of Clytæmnestra.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f486'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r486'>486</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here, as throughout Æschylos, the Olympian divinities are

<div class='footnote' id='f487'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r487'>487</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The accumulation of horrid forms of cruelty had, probably,
a special significance for the Athenians. These punishments
belonged to their enemies, the Persians, not to the Hellenic race,
and the poet's purpose was to rekindle patriotic feeling by
dwelling on their barbarity, as in <cite>Agam.</cite>, v. 894, he points in
like manner to their haughtiness and luxury.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f488'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r488'>488</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The argument of the Erinnyes is, to some extent, like that
of the Antigone of Sophocles (<cite>Antig.</cite>, 909-913), and the wife of
Intaphernes (Herod. iii. 119). The tie which binds the husband
to the wife is less sacred than that between the mother and
the son. This, therefore, brings on the slayer the guilt of blood
of kin, while murder in the other case is reduced to simple
homicide. Orestes therefore was not justified in perpetrating
the greater crime as a retribution for the less. Apollo, in meeting
this plea, asserts the sacredness of the marriage bond as
standing on the same level as that of consanguinity.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f489'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r489'>489</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The ideal interval of time between the two parts of the
drama is left undefined, but it would seem from vv. 230, 274-6,
and 429, to have been long enough to have allowed of many
wanderings to sacred places, Orestes does not go straight from
Delphi to Athens. He appears now, not as before dripping and
besmeared with blood, but with hands and garments purified.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f490'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r490'>490</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The story of Adrastos and Crœsos in Herod. i. 35, illustrates
the gradual purification of which Orestes speaks. The
penitent who has the stain of blood-guiltiness upon him comes
to the king, and the king, as his host, performs the lustral rites
for him. Here Orestes urges that he has been received at many
homes, and gone through many such lustrations. He has been
cleansed from the pollution of sin: what he now seeks, to use
the terminology of a later system, is a forensic justification.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f493'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r493'>493</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The names Triton and Tritonis, wherever found in classical
geography (Libya, Crete, Thessaly, Bœotia), are always connected
with the legend that Athena was born there. Probably
both name and legend were carried from Greece to Libya, and
then amalgamated with the indigenous local worship of a warlike
goddess. Hesiod (iv. 180, 188) connects the Libyan lake
with the legend of Jason and Argonauts.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r494'>494</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the war with the giants fought in the Phlegræan plains
(the volcanic district of Campania) Athena had helped her father
Zeus by her wise counsel, and was honoured there as keeping in
check the destructive Titanic forces which had been so subdued,
burying Enkelados, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, in Sicily. The “friends” are her
Libyan worshippers. The passage is interesting, as showing
the extent of Æschylos's acquaintance with the African and
Italian coasts of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r498'>498</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The thought which underlies the obscurity of a corrupt
passage seems to be that, as they relieve the Gods from the task
of being avengers of blood, all that the Gods on their side can
legitimately do against them is to render powerless the prayers
for vengeance offered by the kindred of the slain. Their very
isolation, as Chthonian deities, from the Gods of Olympos should
protect them from open conflict. But an alternative rendering
of the second line gives, perhaps, a better meaning—</p>

Sigeion. Athena asserts that it had been given to her by the
whole body of Achæans at the time when they had taken Troïa.
Comp. Herod. vv. 94, 95. It probably entered into the political
purposes of the play to excite the Athenians to a war in this
direction, so as to draw them off from the constitutional changes
proposed by Pericles and Ephialtes.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f501'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r501'>501</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here, and throughout the trial, we have to bear in mind the
technicalities of Athenian judicial procedure. The prosecutor,
in the first instance, tendered to the accused an oath that he was
not guilty. This he might accept or refuse. In the latter case,
the course of the trial was at least stopped, and judgment might
be recorded against him. If he could bring himself to accept
it, he was acquitted of the special charge of which he was
accused, but he was liable to a prosecution afterwards for that
perjury. If, on the other hand, he tendered an oath affirming
his guilt to the prosecutor, he placed himself in his hands.
Orestes, not being able to deny the fact, will not declare on
oath that he is “not guilty,” but neither will he place himself in
the power of his accusers. The peculiarities of this use of
oaths were: (1) That they were taken by the parties to the suit,
not by the witnesses. (2) That if both parties agreed to that
mode of decision, the oath was either way decisive. An allusion
to the latter practice is found in Heb. vi. 16, and traces of it are
found in the law-proceedings of Scotland. If either party refused,
the cause had to be tried in the usual way, and witnesses were
called.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f502'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r502'>502</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Æschylos seems here to attach himself to the principles of
those who were seeking to reform the practice described in the
previous note as being at once cumbrous and unjust, throwing
its weight into the scale of the least scrupulous conscience, and
to urge a simpler, more straightforward trial. The same objection
is noticed by Aristotle in his discussion of the subject.

Deioneus, Zeus had had compassion to him, received him as a

Athenian soil, not a criminal fugitive to be simply surrendered;
(2) to offer to the Erinnyes, as being too important to be put
out of court, a fair and open trial; (3) to acknowledge that he

between husband and wife was less close than that between

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r520'>520</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this new argument, and the answer to it, we may trace,
as in the <cite>Prometheus</cite> and the <cite>Agamemnon</cite>, the struggles of the
questioning intellect against the more startling elements of the
popular religious belief. Zeus is worshipped as the supreme
Lord, yet His dominion seems founded on might as opposed to
goodness, on the unrighteous expulsion of another. Here, in
Apollo's answer, there is a glimmer of a possible reconciliation.
The old and the new, the sovereignty of Cronos and that of
Zeus may be reconciled, and one supreme God be “all in all.”</p>

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f522'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r522'>522</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The last argument is, that the acquittal can be, at the best,
partial only, not complete; formal, not real. There would
remain for ever the pollution which would exclude Orestes from
the <em>Phratria</em>, the clan-brotherhood, by which, as by a sacramental
bond, all the members were held together.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f523'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r523'>523</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The question seems to have been one of those which occupied
men's minds in their first gropings towards the mysteries of
man's physical life, and both popular metaphors and primary
impressions were in favour of the hypothesis here maintained.
Euripides (<cite>Orest.</cite>, v. 534) puts the same argument into the mouth
of Orestes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r524'>524</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The story of Athena's birth, full-grown, from the head of

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f525'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r525'>525</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here, of course, the political interest of the whole drama
reached its highest point. What seems comparatively flat to us
must, to the thousands who sat as spectators, have been fraught
with the most intense excitement, showing itself in shouts of
applause, or audible tokens of clamorous dissent. The rivalry
of Whigs and Tories over Addison's <cite>Cato</cite>, the sensation produced
in times of Papal aggression by the king's answer to
Pandulph in <cite>King John</cite>, presents analogies which are worth
remembering.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f526'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r526'>526</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The story ran that the tribe of women warriors from the
Caucasos, or the Thermodon, known by this name, had invaded
Attica under Oreithyia, when Theseus was king, to revenge the
wrongs he had done them, and to recover her sister Hippolyta.
Ares, the God of Thrakians, Skythians, and nearly all the
wilder barbaric tribes, was their special deity; and when they
occupied the hill which rose over against the Acropolis, they
sacrificed to him, and so it gained the name of the <em>Areopagos</em>, or
“hill of Ares.”</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f527'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r527'>527</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As in the <cite>Agamemnon</cite> (v. 1010), so here we find the aristocratic
conservative poet showing his colours, protesting against
the admission to the Archonship, and therefore to the Areopagos,
of men of low birth or in undignified employments.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f528'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r528'>528</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words, like all political clap-trap, are somewhat vague;
but, as understood at the time, the “lawless” policy alluded to
was that of Pericles and Ephialtes, who sought to deface and to
diminish the jurisdiction of the Areopagos, and the “tyrannical,”
that which had crushed the independence of Athens under
Peisistratos. Between the two was the conservative party, of
which Kimon had been the leader.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f529'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r529'>529</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Skythians may be named simply as representing all
barbarous, non-Hellenic races; but they appear, about this
time, wild and nomadic as their life was, to have impressed the
minds of the Greeks somewhat in the same way as the Germans
did the minds of the Romans in the time of Tacitus. Tales
floated from travellers' lips of their wisdom and their happiness—of
sages like Zamolxis and Aristarchos, who rivalled those of
Hellas—of the Hyperborei, in the far north, who enjoyed a
perpetual and unequalled blessedness.—Comp. <cite>Libation-Pourers</cite>,
v. 366.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f530'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r530'>530</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two topics of praise are briefly touched on: (1) the lower,
popular courts of justice at Athens might be open to the suspicion
of corruption, but no breath of slander had ever tainted the
fame of the Areopagos; (2) it met by night, keeping its watch,
that the citizens might sleep in peace.</p>

into one of the urns, and is followed by another at the
end of each of the short two-line speeches in the dialogue that
follows. The two urns of acquittal and condemnation stand in
front of them. The plan of voting with different coloured balls
(black and white) in the same urn, was a later usage.</p>

in Thessalia, Apollo is represented as having first given wine to
the Destinies, and then persuaded them to allow Admetos,
whenever the hour of death should come, to be redeemed from
Hades, if father, or mother, or wife were willing to die for him.
The self-surrender of his wife, Alkestis, for this purpose, forms
the subject of the noblest of the tragedies of Euripides.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
